# Assignment 2.04: Sofa Modeling Assignment

**Due:** No Due Date  
**Points:** 100  
**Submission:** Text entry box, website URL, media recording, or file upload

## Introduction: Sofa Modeling

For this assignment, students will create a 3D sofa using various modeling techniques. This project allows students to explore different methods of creating furniture models while developing their understanding of complex geometry, materials, and realistic modeling approaches. Students are encouraged to try different guides or tutorials to find the approach that works best for their creative vision.

## Instructions

Create a 3D sofa using your preferred modeling techniques. Feel free to follow different guides or tutorials as there are always multiple methods to create a sofa in 3D. Focus on creating a realistic, well-structured model that demonstrates your understanding of furniture modeling principles.

**Submit your 3D Sofa by Sunday, 11:59 PM**

- [ ] **Add subdivision surfaces** - Smooth geometry for organic shapes
- [ ] **Model cushion details** - Seams, tufting, or decorative elements
- [ ] **Create supporting structure** - Legs, frame, or base elements

### Advanced Features

- [ ] **Create realistic cushion deformation** - Soft, compressed appearance
- [ ] **Add decorative elements** - Buttons, trim, or other details
- [ ] **Include matching accessories** - Throw pillows, blankets, or side table
- [ ] **Create multiple sofa variations** - Different styles or configurations

### Scene Setup and Presentation
- [ ] **Set up proper lighting** - Illuminate the sofa effectively
- [ ] **Choose appropriate camera angle** - Show off the model effectively
- [ ] **Apply realistic materials** - Fabric, leather, or upholstery textures
- [ ] **Final render setup** - High-quality output settings
- [ ] **Quality review and refinement** - Check for modeling errors

### Project Deliverables
- [ ] **Scene file** - Complete sofa model (.max, .blend, or other format)
- [ ] **Final rendered image** - High-quality render (.png or .jpg)

## Modeling Approaches

### Box Modeling Method
1. **Start with a box** - Create the main sofa frame
2. **Extrude and bevel** - Shape the basic form
3. **Add edge loops** - Create smooth transitions
4. **Model cushions separately** - Create individual cushion objects
5. **Combine and refine** - Merge elements and add details

### Spline Modeling Method
1. **Create spline profiles** - Draw sofa cross-sections
2. **Use loft or sweep** - Generate 3D geometry from splines
3. **Add thickness** - Use shell or extrude modifiers
4. **Refine geometry** - Adjust control points and curves
5. **Create cushion geometry** - Model cushions using similar techniques

### Sculpting Method
1. **Start with base mesh** - Create low-poly foundation
2. **Subdivide geometry** - Add resolution for sculpting
3. **Sculpt main forms** - Shape the sofa structure
4. **Add surface details** - Create fabric texture and seams
5. **Retopologize if needed** - Clean up geometry for final use

## Material and Texture Tips

### Fabric Materials
1. **Choose appropriate fabric type** - Cotton, velvet, leather, etc.
2. **Apply realistic textures** - Use high-quality fabric maps
3. **Add surface details** - Bump maps for weave patterns
4. **Consider wear patterns** - Areas of use and aging
5. **Match lighting response** - Proper specular and roughness values

### Cushion Materials
1. **Soft appearance** - Low specular, high roughness
2. **Realistic compression** - Subtle deformation modeling
3. **Seam details** - Visible stitching or tufting
4. **Color variation** - Slight differences in fabric dye
5. **Wear and aging** - Realistic use patterns

## Assessment Criteria

### Excellent Work Should Include:
- Realistic proportions and scale
- Clean, well-structured geometry
- Professional material application
- Detailed cushion modeling
- Good lighting and presentation
- Additional decorative elements or accessories

### Common Issues to Avoid:
- Unrealistic proportions (too wide, too narrow, etc.)
- Poor geometry with n-gons or triangles
- Basic or missing materials
- Repetitive or identical cushion models
- Poor lighting setup
- Modeling errors or gaps in geometry
