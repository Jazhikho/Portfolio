# Assignment 1.06: 3DS Max 3D Primitives Scene
## Getting Started with 3D Space

### Assignment Instructions
Let's begin working with 3DS Max by getting used to working in 3D space. While it may sound odd as we live in 3D space, working in 3D through a 2D interface can be a bit tricky for some. For this first assignment we are going to get to know the interface and build our first 3d objects using 3D primitive objects.

For the assignment I want you to assemble a 3D scene using these basic objects, you can create a castle, an ice-cream cone or anything of your choice. However I want to see something that shows effort and an understanding of 3d space.

### Required Deliverables
- [x] .max file (3DS Max project file)
- [x] .png file (rendered image)

## Lab Rubric Checklist

### 1. Project Completion (25 pts)
**Criteria:** Project finished 100%, all requirements completed, submitted on time

- [x] **Excellent (25 pts)** - Student finished 100% of project, completed ALL requirements, submitted on time
- [ ] **Good (13 pts)** - Student finished project, completed most requirements, submitted on time
- [ ] **Fair (7 pts)** - Student completed project, completed half of requirements, submitted on time
- [ ] **Poor (5 pts)** - Student completed project, did not complete requirements and/or not on time
- [ ] **Incomplete (1 pts)** - Student did not finish project, refused, or abandoned project

**Assessment:**

All required files are present (.max and .png) and the scene now includes additional elements beyond the basic donut setup. You incorporated a plate, a table, and a teapot, demonstrating a complete submission. Everything was submitted as requested and on time. **Score: 25/25.**

### 2. Technical Difficulty & Editing Techniques (25 pts)
**Criteria:** Project meets/exceeds technical expectations, shows appropriate complexity

- [ ] **Excellent (25 pts)** - Project exceeds technical expectations, shows complexity beyond scope
- [x] **Good (13 pts)** - Project meets all technical expectations, complexity in line with scope
- [ ] **Fair (7 pts)** - Project meets most technical expectations, just below scope
- [ ] **Poor (4 pts)** - Project fails to meet technical expectations, lacks complexity
- [ ] **Incomplete (1 pts)** - Failed to meet technical expectations, looks thrown together

**Assessment:**

You modelled and instanced multiple primitives (donuts, sprinkles, plate, teapot, table) and assigned a variety of materials. The sprinkles distribution and varied materials show you understand modelling and scattering tools. Adding the table surface allowed cast shadows. Lighting and rendering quality, however, remain basic: the scene could benefit from refined light rigging, softer shadows, and better texture maps. **Score: 13/25.**

---

### 3. Project Guidelines (25 pts)
**Criteria:** All required elements present, guidelines followed completely

- [x] **Excellent (25 pts)** - All required elements present, guidelines followed completely, goes beyond tutorial
- [ ] **Good (13 pts)** - All required elements present, guidelines followed completely
- [ ] **Fair (7 pts)** - Guidelines mostly complete, all required elements present
- [ ] **Poor (4 pts)** - Missing important project requirement
- [ ] **Incomplete (1 pts)** - Missing 2+ project requirements

**Assessment:**

The assignment asked for a scene assembled from primitive objects. You delivered donuts, a plate, a teapot and a table using cylinders, tori, and other primitives, going beyond the basic tutorial. All deliverables were included. **Score: 25/25.**

### 4. Project Quality and Craft (25 pts)
**Criteria:** Project is neat, carefully constructed, demonstrates effort

- [ ] **Excellent (25 pts)** - Project neat and carefully constructed, extra effort, added embellishments
- [x] **Good (13 pts)** - Project neat and carefully constructed, good effort, met minimum
- [ ] **Fair (7 pts)** - Project constructed poorly or messy, but effort shown
- [ ] **Poor (4 pts)** - Project appears built with little effort
- [ ] **Incomplete (1 pts)** - Little apparent effort, minimum not met

**Assessment:**

Objects are placed logically, the plate anchors the donuts, and the table provides context. Shadows fall onto the table, and the teapot adds interest. Nevertheless, materials still look procedural (the wood texture is flat, the icing lacks translucency) and the lighting is harsh. A more refined look with better textures and softer lights would elevate it further. **Score: 13/25.**

---

## Summary
**Total Criteria Assessable:** 4/4 ✅

**Files Submitted:** 
- ✅ donuts(3DSMaxTest).max
- ✅ donutsRender(3DSMaxTest).png

**Overall Assessment:**

You significantly improved your scene by adding context (table, plate, teapot) and cast shadows. The project meets all the assignment requirements and shows good modelling and material use. To reach an “excellent” level, focus on finer material detail (bump/roughness maps, subtle reflections), sophisticated light rigging, and a more photographic render setup (soft area lights, depth of field).  

**Final Score:** **76 / 100** – Solid B level work with clear improvements over the original.
