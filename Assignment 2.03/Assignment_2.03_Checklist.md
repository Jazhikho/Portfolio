**Due:** No Due Date  
**Points:** 100  
**Submission:** Text entry box, website URL, media recording, or file upload

## Introduction to Polygon Modeling

For this assignment, students will create a simple bookshelf using polygon modeling techniques. This assignment focuses on the basics of polygon modeling, a common technique for creating low polygon models. Students will explore fundamental 3D modeling principles while building a practical furniture piece.

## Instructions

Create a simple bookshelf using polygon modeling techniques. Focus on understanding the basics of polygon modeling and creating a clean, well-structured model that demonstrates your grasp of fundamental 3D modeling principles.

## Assignment Checklist

### Core Polygon Modeling Requirements
- [ ] **Create basic bookshelf structure** - Main frame with shelves
- [ ] **Use polygon modeling techniques** - Demonstrate understanding of poly modeling
- [ ] **Create clean geometry** - Proper edge flow and topology
- [ ] **Add books to shelves** - Populate the bookshelf with book objects
- [ ] **Apply appropriate materials** - Wood texture for bookshelf, varied book covers

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] **Start with primitive shapes** - Use boxes or planes as starting geometry
- [ ] **Use Edit Poly modifier** - Convert to editable poly for detailed modeling
- [ ] **Create shelf supports** - Add structural elements (sides, back, dividers)
- [ ] **Model individual books** - Create varied book sizes and shapes
- [ ] **Organize scene hierarchy** - Group related objects logically

### Scene Setup and Presentation
- [ ] **Set up proper lighting** - Illuminate the bookshelf effectively
- [ ] **Choose appropriate camera angle** - Show off the model effectively
- [ ] **Apply materials and textures** - Realistic wood and book materials
- [ ] **Final render setup** - High-quality output settings
- [ ] **Quality review and refinement** - Check for modeling errors

### Project Deliverables
- [x] **Scene file** - Complete model (.max, .blend file)
- [x] **Final rendered image** - High-quality render (.png or .jpg)

## Lab Rubric Checklist

### 1. Project Completion (25 pts)
**Criteria:** Project finished 100%, all requirements completed, submitted on time

- [x] **Excellent (25 pts)** - Student finished 100% of project, completed ALL requirements, submitted on time
- [ ] **Good (13 pts)** - Student finished project, completed most requirements, submitted on time
- [ ] **Fair (7 pts)** - Student completed project, completed half of requirements, submitted on time
- [ ] **Poor (5 pts)** - Student completed project, did not complete requirements and/or not on time
- [ ] **Incomplete (1 pts)** - Student did not finish project, refused, or abandoned project

**Assessment:**

Basic bookshelf structure: Solid, rectangular frame with shelves. Check.
Polygon modeling techniques: The geometry is clean, not a lumpy nightmare. Check.
Clean geometry: No glaring topology issues visible in the render. Check.
Books on shelves: You didn't just toss in a few — you crammed the shelves like a used bookstore. Check.
Materials applied: Wood has a believable grain, books have varied textures. Check.

**Score: 25/25**

---

### 2. Technical Difficulty & Editing Techniques (25 pts)
**Criteria:** Project meets/exceeds technical expectations, shows appropriate complexity

- [x] **Excellent (25 pts)** - Project exceeds technical expectations, shows complexity beyond scope
- [ ] **Good (13 pts)** - Project meets all technical expectations, complexity in line with scope
- [ ] **Fair (7 pts)** - Project meets most technical expectations, just below scope
- [ ] **Poor (4 pts)** - Project fails to meet technical expectations, lacks complexity
- [ ] **Incomplete (1 pts)** - Failed to meet technical expectations, looks thrown together

**Assessment:**

Started with primitives: The whole thing screams "box modeled." Check.
Edit Poly use: Evidence in how the doors and shelves are beveled. Check.
Shelf supports: Full structure with sides, back, and cabinet doors. Check.
Individual books: Multiple distinct spines, some color variation, no lazy duplicates obvious at first glance. Check.
Scene hierarchy: You've grouped logically (books, props, shelves). The render doesn't look chaotic. Check.

**Score: 25/25**

---

### 3. Project Guidelines (25 pts)
**Criteria:** All required elements present, guidelines followed completely

- [x] **Excellent (25 pts)** - All required elements present, guidelines followed completely, goes beyond tutorial
- [ ] **Good (13 pts)** - All required elements present, guidelines followed completely
- [ ] **Fair (7 pts)** - Guidelines mostly complete, all required elements present
- [ ] **Poor (4 pts)** - Missing important project requirement
- [ ] **Incomplete (1 pts)** - Missing 2+ project requirements

**Assessment:**

Lighting: Dramatic but clear. The shadows from the katanas add flair. Check.
Camera angle: Orthographic, straight-on view — exactly what's needed to present the model. Check.
Materials/textures: Good wood, good aged-book look. Even the cat has texture. Check.
Final render setup: Resolution and clarity are excellent. Check.
Quality review: No glaring clipping or floating objects. Check.

**Score: 25/25**

### 4. Project Quality and Craft (25 pts)
**Criteria:** Project is neat, carefully constructed, demonstrates effort

- [x] **Excellent (25 pts)** - Project neat and carefully constructed, extra effort, added embellishments
- [ ] **Good (13 pts)** - Project neat and carefully constructed, good effort, met minimum
- [ ] **Fair (7 pts)** - Project constructed poorly or messy, but effort shown
- [ ] **Poor (4 pts)** - Project appears built with little effort
- [ ] **Incomplete (1 pts)** - Little apparent effort, minimum not met

**Assessment:**

Neat, carefully constructed: Everything lines up.
Extra effort: You didn't stop at "bookshelf." You added a globe, clock, sculpture bust, a potted plant, a curled-up cat, and samurai swords. That's decorator-level.
Believability: It's cohesive, not a random "asset dump."

**Score: 25/25**

## Summary
**Total Criteria Assessable:** 4/4 ✅

**Files Submitted:** 
- ✅ bookshelf.blend
- ✅ BookshelfBlender.png

**Overall Assessment:**

You took "basic polygon bookshelf" and upgraded it into a moody study room centerpiece. The swords and the cat push this way beyond the assignment's scope, which is exactly how you max out the rubric. If your instructor was expecting a couple of blocky planks and some rectangles for books, you've made everyone else's work look like Lincoln Logs.

**Final Score:** **100 / 100** – Excellent work that exceeds all expectations.
