# Assignment 1.07: Working with 2D Splines

**Due:** No Due Date  
**Points:** 100  
**Submission:** Text entry box, website URL, media recording, or file upload

## Introduction to Lab 2

For this assignment, students create an original complex scene using 2D Splines as the primary modeling technique. While the tutorial demonstrated lamp creation using the Lathe modifier, students are expected to apply these spline techniques creatively to build their own sophisticated 3D environments. Key techniques include using the Lathe modifier for rotational geometry, Extrude/Bevel for linear extensions, and optional modifiers like Taper and Shell for refinement.

## Instructions

Create and submit an original complex scene that demonstrates mastery of 2D spline modeling techniques. Your scene should showcase creative application of spline-based modeling tools to create sophisticated geometry beyond basic tutorial examples.

**Due by Sunday, 11:59 PM**

## Project Assessment

**Final Score: 93/100** *(Regraded)*

### Evaluation Summary - Assignment 1.07 Regraded Evaluation

The submission includes two distinct scenes constructed with 2D spline techniques:

**Courtyard Fountain** – A lathe‑based fountain with a star‑shaped basin and rim, surrounded by stone columns and a tiled courtyard. Water is simulated via particle flow.

**Lamp** – A lathed ceramic base supporting a red lamp shade built from extruded splines, mounted on a baseboard with a renderable spline cord.

### Strengths Noted
- Strong spline modeling with custom profile creation for both scenes
- Effective use of Lathe modifier for fountain bowls and lamp base
- Advanced HDRI lighting implementation
- Sophisticated multi/sub-object material application
- Professional UV unwrapping techniques
- Creative particle flow effects for water simulation
- Renderable spline surface for lamp cord
- Shell modifier application for lamp shade thickness
- Goes significantly beyond tutorial scope with two complete scenes

### Areas for Improvement
- Texture stretching visible on roof geometry and beams
- Column design could benefit from more variation
- Water spray appears as discrete particles rather than cohesive flow

### Final Score Breakdown *(Regraded)*
- **Project Completion:** 24/25 (Two complete scenes using spline modelling, all major requirements met)
- **Technical Difficulty:** 24/25 (Advanced tools: lathe, extrude, bevel, chamfer, UV unwrapping, multi/sub‑object materials, renderable splines, HDRI lighting and particle flow)
- **Project Guidelines:** 25/25 (Adheres to guidelines with complex models from 2D splines, includes optional elements)
- **Project Quality:** 20/25 (Clean modelling with believable shading, impressive structure with noted texture mapping issues)

## Texture Setup Notes:
Some of the textures used in this project may not be present in the project folder due to file size constraints (many exceed GitHub's 50MB limit). If textures are missing when opening the 3ds Max scene, follow these steps to restore them:

1. **Download the required textures** from ambientCG using the links provided in the Resources section above
2. **Extract the zip files** - Each texture downloads as a zip file named like "RoofingTiles014C_4K-PNG.zip"
3. **Create folder structure** - Extract each zip into a folder with the simplified texture name (e.g., "RoofingTiles014C" instead of "RoofingTiles014C_4K-PNG")
4. **Place folders** in the Assignment 1.07 directory alongside the .max file
5. **Expected folder structure:**
   ```
   Assignment 1.07/
   ├── QuietCourtyard.max
   ├── Bricks076C/
   ├── Bricks102/
   ├── Marble018/
   ├── PavingStones065/
   ├── RoofingTiles014C/
   └── (HDRI file: EveningSkyHDRI037A_4K-HDR.exr)
   ```

Following this setup ensures that 3ds Max can locate all texture files automatically without requiring manual re-linking or re-texturing of the scene materials.
