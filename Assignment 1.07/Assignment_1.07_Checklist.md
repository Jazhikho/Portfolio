# Assignment 1.07: Working with 2D Splines

**Due:** No Due Date  
**Points:** 100  
**Submission:** Text entry box, website URL, media recording, or file upload

## Introduction to Lab 2

For this assignment, students create an original complex scene using 2D Splines as the primary modeling technique. While the tutorial demonstrated lamp creation using the Lathe modifier, students are expected to apply these spline techniques creatively to build their own sophisticated 3D environments. Key techniques include using the Lathe modifier for rotational geometry, Extrude/Bevel for linear extensions, and optional modifiers like Taper and Shell for refinement.

## Instructions

Create and submit an original complex scene that demonstrates mastery of 2D spline modeling techniques. Your scene should showcase creative application of spline-based modeling tools to create sophisticated geometry beyond basic tutorial examples.

**Due by Sunday, 11:59 PM**

### Evaluation Summary
This courtyard fountain scene demonstrates sophisticated understanding of 3ds Max spline modeling techniques. The project successfully showcases custom profile splines, lathe operations for bowl geometry, and extrude/bevel operations for architectural elements. Advanced features including HDRI lighting, multi/sub-object materials, UV unwrapping, and particle flow effects elevate the technical complexity well beyond basic requirements.

### Strengths Noted
- Strong spline modeling with custom profile creation
- Effective use of Lathe modifier for fountain bowls
- Advanced HDRI lighting implementation
- Sophisticated multi/sub-object material application
- Professional UV unwrapping techniques
- Creative particle flow effects for water simulation
- Goes significantly beyond tutorial scope

### Areas for Improvement
- Texture stretching visible on roof geometry
- Column design could benefit from more variation

### Score Breakdown
- **Project Completion:** 22/25 (Excellent work with minor refinements needed)
- **Technical Difficulty:** 25/25 (Exceeds expectations with advanced techniques)
- **Project Guidelines:** 22/25 (Goes beyond tutorial, follows spline requirements)
- **Project Quality:** 19/25 (Good construction with noted texture issues)

## Texture Setup Notes:
Some of the textures used in this project may not be present in the project folder due to file size constraints (many exceed GitHub's 50MB limit). If textures are missing when opening the 3ds Max scene, follow these steps to restore them:

1. **Download the required textures** from ambientCG using the links provided in the Resources section above
2. **Extract the zip files** - Each texture downloads as a zip file named like "RoofingTiles014C_4K-PNG.zip"
3. **Create folder structure** - Extract each zip into a folder with the simplified texture name (e.g., "RoofingTiles014C" instead of "RoofingTiles014C_4K-PNG")
4. **Place folders** in the Assignment 1.07 directory alongside the .max file
5. **Expected folder structure:**
   ```
   Assignment 1.07/
   ├── QuietCourtyard.max
   ├── Bricks076C/
   ├── Bricks102/
   ├── Marble018/
   ├── PavingStones065/
   ├── RoofingTiles014C/
   └── (HDRI file: EveningSkyHDRI037A_4K-HDR.exr)
   ```

Following this setup ensures that 3ds Max can locate all texture files automatically without requiring manual re-linking or re-texturing of the scene materials.
