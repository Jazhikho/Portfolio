# Assignment 1.07: Working with 2D Splines

**Due:** No Due Date  
**Points:** 100  
**Submission:** Text entry box, website URL, media recording, or file upload

## Introduction to Lab 2

For this assignment we are going to jump in to creating a complex model using 2D Splines. We will be primarily using the Lathe modifier to generate most of our lamp's geometry. We will also be using Extrude/Bevel, Taper and the Shell modifiers to create the lamp shade and finally we will be changing the render settings to generate a renderable surface for a spline to use as a cord.

## Instructions

Submit your complex model using 2D Splines.

**Due by Sunday, 11:59 PM**
